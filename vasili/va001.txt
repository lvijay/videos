⑳  This is a story about the world's
bravest man.

  In 2022, President Vladimir Putin,
worried about ¶NATO's¶ missiles at
its border, invaded Ukraine.

was right to be worried.

  ¶USSR¶'s nuclear armed submarines
were off Cuba's coast.  Disregarding
the risks of nuclear war, Kennedy
ordered his Navy to attack the
submarines.

  The submarine captain, afraid that
World War III was ongoing, decided to
retaliate with nukes.  Soviet missile
protocol required that 3 officers
agree for firing a nuke.  Two
commanders gave the order but one
didn't.  That one man averted a
nuclear war, prevented World War ¶III¶,
and saved human life on this planet.

  That man was Vasili Arkhipov.⑳«¢
