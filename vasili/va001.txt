⑳  In 2022, President Vladimir Putin,
worried about ¶NATO's¶ missiles in
its border, invaded Ukraine.
Typo⑤‹‹‹‹«æ\««¢p««¢p««¢p««æm««æf««¢f«›››196«æf««æf««æd««æd« John F. Kennedy©

Kennedy, it turned out, was right
to be worried.

  USSR's nuclear armed submarines
were just off Cuba's coast.
Disregarding the risks of nuclear
war, Kennedy gave the order to
attack these submarines.  Angered,
USSR ordered the submarines to fire
their nukes at the US.

  Soviet nuclear missile protocol
required that the 3 fleet commanders
on deck agree to firing a nuke.  Two
commanders gave the order but one
didn't.  That one man averted a
nuclear war, prevented World War III
and saved human life on this planet.

  He is the reason we are alive today.

  That man was Vasili Arkhipov.
