/* ¶A self-modifying Java program¶ */
¶/* ----------------------------- */¶
Σ

Today we see a Java program that changes a final String.

We'll first see the program in action and then see the code.

Here's a final String and its hashCode.

Σ// ¶Today¶ ¶we see¶ ¶a Java¶ ¶program¶ ¶that¶ ¶changes¶ ¶a final String.¶
¶final¶ ¶String¶ ¶theTarget¶ = "¶[#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:]¶";
¶theTarget; theTarget¶.h¶ashCode();¶
ωΣ

Next we call A method named mod if eye memory.  It runs for a few
seconds and once it's done, we see that the string has changed but its
hashCode hasn't.

ΣmodifyMemory();
theTarget; theTarget.hashCode();
ωΣ

We pulled this off by reading the jay-shell process's memory in ram,
looked for the string's contents and updating it in memory.

Σ// ¶How was it done¶?  ¶Answer:¶
// ¶read jshell's¶ ¶memory¶ ¶in RAM¶, ¶looked¶ ¶for¶ ¶"#:#: ... #:#:"¶, ¶and¶
// ¶replaced¶ ¶it¶ ¶with¶, ¶"colorless green ideas sleep furiously"¶.
ωΣ

There are other solutions too.  See the link in the description for
two such.  While those solutions are particular to the Java Platform
this solution is programming ecosystem independent but works only on
the geh-noo slash linux operating system.  It won't work on other
O.S.-es as is.
