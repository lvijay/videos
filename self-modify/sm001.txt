Today, we are modifying the contents of A final String.  Here's a
final String and its hashCode.

Σ// ¶Today¶ ¶we are¶ ¶modifying¶ ¶the contents¶ ¶of a final String.¶
¶final¶ ¶String¶ ¶theTarget¶ = "¶[#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:#:]¶";
¶theTarget; theTarget¶.h¶ashCode();¶ω
Σ

Next we call A method named do-the-deed.  It runs for a few seconds
but once it's done, we see that the string has changed but its
hashCode hasn't.

ΣdoTheDeed();
theTarget; theTarget.hashCode();
ωΣ

How was it done?  Answer: I read jay-shell's memory in ram, looked for
the string's contents and updated it in memory.

Σ// ¶How'd I do it¶?  ¶Answer:¶
// ¶I read jshell's¶ ¶memory¶ ¶in RAM¶, ¶looked¶ ¶for¶ ¶"#:#: ... #:#:"¶, ¶and¶
// ¶wrote¶, ¶"colorless green ideas sleep furiously"¶ ¶there¶.ω

There are other solutions too.  See the link in the description for
two other solutions.  While those solutions are particular to the Java
Platform this solution is programming ecosystem independent but works
only on the guh-noo slash linux operating system.  It won't work on
others as is.
