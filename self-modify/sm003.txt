# ¶-------------------------------------¶
# 1. Computers have a temporary memory store called Random Access Memory.
#    RAM for short.
# 2. Programs are stored on disk.  They contain instructions particular
#    to their Operating System.  That's why Windows programs are different
#    from Mac OS X programs which are different from the various flavors
#    of GNU/Linux and so on.
# 3. Operating Systems run programs by copying their contents into RAM
#    and executing those contents.
