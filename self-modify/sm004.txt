First we disable line wrap.

Σ«¢x«xtωΣ

Every line is a page in memory.  Each line has six columns.  They are

address, permissions, offset, device, eye-node, and file

Σ«¢o«¶address, permissions, offset, device, inode, file¶«¢f«©
ωΣ

The first field is address range.  It has the start and end addresses
separated by a hyphen.  The addresses are represented in
hex-ah-decimal.

Σ«¢ ««æf««¢f««æf«ω©

The second field shows the permissions on the page.  It's the usual
you-nix terms with R meaning reed, W meaning write, X meaning
executable.  I don't know what P means.
