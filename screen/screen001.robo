# ⊂What is GNU Screen?⊃«⌘v»

⊂# It's a program to manage multiple terminals on a single window⊃«⌘v»
⊂# without reaching for the mouse.  It has some great features such as:⊃«⌘v»

# ⊂1. create and manage multiple terminals⊃«⌘v»
# ⊂2. name your terminals⊃«⌘v»
# ⊂3. receive an alert when a process prints its output⊃«⌘v»

# customize it.  Create a file named ɛ31&100:.screenrcɜ in the home directory
# and add the below contents to it.  You can also download it from the
# gist in the description.
