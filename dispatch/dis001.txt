How well do you know Java's method dispatch?  Let's explore it with
our trusted java tool, jay-shell.  Jay-shell was introduced in Java 9.

We declare 3 classes with a simple theme.  The first class, named
Fruit, has an instance member named taste.  Since an abstract fruit
does not have any taste, we don't define its taste.  The next class is
Melon which extends Fruit.  Its taste is squishy.

The third and last class is Watermelon.  It extends Melon and its
taste is sweet.

Now we come to the puzzle-defining class.  We have a class named
Dispatch that has a method named described in 3 overloaded variants.
All methods take only one argument.  One of Fruit, Melon, or
Watermelon.  Their method bodies are similar too.  In each case they
call a print method with two strings.  The first string is the
argument's class and the second is the instance member taste.

The method print is a simple method that prints to the system console.

Question 1: Which method is invoked?
    is it the method that takes Fruit?  Melon?  or Watermelon?
Question 2: What does it print?  We have 9 choices:
(a) This fruit is --- (b) This fruit is squishy (c) This fruit is sweet
(d) This melon is --- (e) This melon is squishy (f) This melon is sweet
(g) This watermelon is --- (h) This watermelon is squishy
(i) This watermelon is sweet
