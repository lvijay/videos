[there's background noise] https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/talking/

banking: it's so great to be here.  i can't it's 25 years since
         graduation.  $insurance you've been quiet all evening, what's
         on your mind?

insurance: i'm wondering what this group's average salary is.

[silence]

cement: why?

pharma: it's easy to find out.  thanks to linkedin we know where you
        work.  many employers now print the salary range.  there's
        also glassdoor.  and several other places to get the answer.
        do this for everyone and there you have it.

retail: why don't you lead the discussion?  what are /you/ worth?  then
        let everyone share what they're worth.  i'll go last.

banking: i bet everyone volunteers to go last.

cement: that's a problem with announcing it.  every later person will
        lie and even the first has incentive to lie.

pharma: we could each write it on a paper and reveal it at the same
        time.

cement: there's still an incentive there to lie.  everyone will be
        tempted to inflate their net worth.

pharma: well, do you have a solution?  i don't hear you suggesting
        anything.

retail: here's one way.  i'll select an arbitrary number ùìç and pass it
        to $agribusiness.  she'll add her net worth to it and pass it
        to $pharma, who'll add his net worth to it and so on.  When
        the final number comes back to me, i'll subtract ùìç add my net
        worth and announce the total.  that's what this room's worth.

        Since no-one knows the interim values anonymity is preserved.

        And since it's anonymous, there's no incentive to lie.

cement: yeah, but if you collude with $pharma, you can find out
        $agribusiness's networth.  then you might separately collude
        with each neighbor and so on.

retail: do you want to start the circle?

pharma: $cement, you're only finding problems.  i still don't see you
        volunteering a solution.

retail: okay, here's another way.

        it goes as follows.  i take my salary, let's suppose it's
        100K.  i divide it into twelve parts of different sizes such
        that the sum of those parts will add up to 120K.  one random
        division of 100K into 12 parts might be [8806, 16165, 160,
        11707, 4709, 17212, 11045, 2521, 9799, 13953, 17064, 6858].
        there are other random distributions, that's the beauty of
        random.

        to each of you here, i give one of the parts.  the twelfth i
        keep for myself.

        everyone in the room does the same thing.  you take your net
        worth, divide it into twelve parts, and share it with each of
        us.

        i'll have a portion from each of you.  i'll announce my total.
        each of you does the same.  we sum up all total of totals,
        we'll know what this room is worth.

[everyone looks at $cement]

cement: how do i distribute the net worth randomly?  i can get twelve
        random numbers by rolling dice twelve times.  but how do i
        divide my number randomly so nobody guesses the total from
        their portion?
