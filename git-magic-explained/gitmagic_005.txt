# b. parent(s)
# c. author and
# d. committer metadata
# Note that parent e4fe1d2... is the previous commit⑧
# In the last two lines, look at the timestamp

# Decoded, this time is

# This video is made in 2023, how is the date 2020?
# Let's look at the manual
man git-commit | grep 'Author and committer' -A9
# Let's look at the environment variables
echo -e "$GIT_COMMITTER_DATE\n$GIT_AUTHOR_DATE"
⑧①①⑧①①# Since I control all variables of the commit
# I can predict what the commit id will be.
# And that's what I did.
# I hope you see how the entire trick was setup.
# All I had to do was make a commit, note the id,
# reset the git repository, do everything again,
# and hey presto, magic.
# But how did I include c0ffee in the commit?
# We'll see that in the next section.
