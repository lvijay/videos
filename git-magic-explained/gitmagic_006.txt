# We know the format of a git commit
# Given other parameters, we know how to calculate its
# git commit
# I wrote a small program that searched for a commit
# containing 'c0ffee'.  Here it goes
cat ~/other-code/is_it_interesting.py
⑧①①# I won't go through it, you can read it in the
# gist link in the description.
# Running the program gives us the answers
python ~/other-code/is_it_interesting.py
⑧①①⑧①①# And that's that.
