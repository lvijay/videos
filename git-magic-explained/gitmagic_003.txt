# The trick primarily has two parts
# 1. The commit id containing c0ffee
# 2. The random number generator giving us c0ffee
# Let's address (2) first because it's easier.
# The program opened with `python -c 'import random'`
# Python looks for import libraries by examining the
# «⇧pythonpath» environment variable.
# Let's examine the environment property «⇧pythonpath»
echo $«⇧pythonpath»
# It says `..' which refers to the parent directory.
# What does the parent directory contain?
ls ..
# It has a file named random.py.  This tells us Python
# imported this file, not the standard library version.
# What's in random.py?
cat ../random.py
⑧⑧⑧⑧⑧⑧
# The file only has 3 lines of code.  One constant and
# one function.⑧⑧⑧⑧⑧⑧
# The variable ARRAY contains the two constants we got
cat ../random.py | awk '/^ARRAY/'
# but in reverse order.  And
# the function `randint` returns these two constants.
grep -A1 def ../random.py
# by popping them in reverse.

# In summary: we wrote our own random.py file, 
# rigged it to return the two values we needed.  Then
# made sure that Python would pick our random.py file
# by setting «⇧pythonpath».

# Hopefully that explains (2).
# Feel free to comment if you have questions.

# Coming to (1), how'd we know the git commit?⑧⑧⑧⑧⑧
